# Collections [WIP]
Collections is ultimately designed to allow users to manage a custom domain index (with additional information).

As of right now, the system relies on a core CSV file (Collections.csv) to hold data. This may pose a problem; therefore everything is bound to be rewritten.

# TODO

- [x] Master Collection - Started
- [x] Add "popularity" column or ranking column
- [x] Delete Collection(s)
- [x] Implement safeguard to prevent multiple entries of the same URL/ranking
- [x] Do not accept entries with an empty URL
- [x] Sorting options
- [ ] Filtering (settings) 
- [ ] User ability to add/delete columns (settings)
- [ ] Use Alexa API to import data such as genre, description, and ranking (user can turn off in settings) (settings)
- [ ] Live domain check (settings)
- [ ] User doesn't have to install PrettyTables Library
- [ ] Setup CONFIGOBJ 5 for settings file

I am currently working on "Setup PyYAML for settings file"


Feel free to commit some ideas if you want :-)
