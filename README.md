# Collections [Major WIP]
Collections is ultimately designed to allow users to manage a custom domain index (with additional information).

As of right now, the system relies on a core CSV file (Collections.csv) to hold data. This may pose a problem in the future; therefore everything is bound to be rewritten.

I just started this project. Forgive me for only having a few files w/ a few lines.

# TODO

- [ ] Master Collection
- [ ] Add "popularity" column or ranking column
- [x]Sorting options (sort by URL, Genre, Description alphabetically, etc.)
- [ ]Filtering options
- [ ]Use custom ascii tables(really no need for this, the PrettyTables library is fine for this it seems)
- [ ]User ability to add/delete columns (URL, Genre, Description, etc.)
- [ ]Import using API (import from massive lists like Alexa; the URL and Description is already there for you, and already ranked)
- [ ]Delete Collection(s)

# Status

I am currently working on implementing Deleting functionality.


Feel free to commit some ideas if you want :-)
